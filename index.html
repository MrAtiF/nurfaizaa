        <div class="about__text">
          <p>A passionate educator who aims to impart knowledge on students regardless of their learning capabilities, demographics and geographical location.</p>

            <p><span>My Story</span></p>
            <p>
              Hi! I am Faizaa, in my late 20s but definitely younger at heart! The one reason I decide to be a full time tutor is so that i can be among the company of young hearts to make me feel young always!
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a Full-Time Online Tutor who dedicates my time and effort to conduct lessons via different collaborative platforms (i.e. Skype, Google Drive, Whiteboards, etc). My priority is to create tailored teaching strategies and pedagogies to suit the needs
              of students with different learning capabilities and attitudes. I create customised lesson design so no one lesson is the same as the other. My techniques and methods have been proven to effectively improve grades and development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the years, I have gained experiences in tutoring students of different education levels, capabilities and subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am an organized tutor who tracks their progress and our lessons, while also providing feedbacks to their parents whenever necessary. This also implies that I inculcate organized methods, steps and thinking in academics!
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a passionate educator, I love teaching and imparting knowledge to students for the betterment of their future. I would like to help students who are struggling with their academics through my constant motivation and also of course, strategic studying
              tips and tricks.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am patient with students, I am friendly to them but am also firm when the moment requires me to be so. I have had parents telling me that I have been a great help to their kids, that their kids understand my teaching and that I am a dedicated tutor.
              A few parents even said that they only trust me with their kids and no one else! :)</p>
            <p>
              Always hoping to make a difference in a student’s life!
